#Bar Code Generator

A short and concise python program to generated code 39 barcodes. The program is designed to be run from the command line.
Running the program from the terminal, two arguments are accepted. The lowest number bar code to be created and the highest
number barcode to be created. An example of how it would be run in the terminal would look like:

``` python barCodeGenerator.py 1 76``` 

Generated barcodes are exported from the program as a pdf. The command above would generate code 39 barcodes for 1
through 76 with the bar codes appearing in a pdf named 1-76.pdf
